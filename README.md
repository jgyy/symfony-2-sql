## Chapter I: Foreword

One of the most common and challenging tasks for any application involves persisting and reading information to and from a database. Although the Symfony Framework doesn't integrate any component to work with databases, it provides tight integration with a third-party library called Doctrine. Doctrine's sole goal is to give you powerful tools to make database interactions easy and flexible.

## Chapter II: General rules

- Your project must be realized in a virtual machine.
- Your virtual machine must have all the necessary software to complete your project. These softwares must be configured and installed.
- You can choose the operating system to use for your virtual machine.
- You must be able to use your virtual machine from a cluster computer.
- You must use a shared folder between your virtual machine and your host machine.
- During your evaluations you will use this folder to share with your repository.
- Your functions should not quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double free, etc) apart from undefined behaviors. If this happens, your project will be considered non functional and will receive a 0 during the evaluation.
- We encourage you to create test programs for your project even though this work won't have to be submitted and won't be graded.
- Submit your work to your assigned git repository. Only the work in the git repository will be graded.
